This repository is mainly to keep track of non-technical issues around Trustroots that can be handled publicly.

For example:

- support request things that can be handled publicly (some of these things can become FAQ items)
- how to get more people to work on these issues
- Kasper's personal (yet public) goals for Trustroots
